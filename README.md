### Debugging

* In browser debugging works using [node-inspector](https://github.com/dannycoates/node-inspector)

* In your terminal you can use built in debugger (just like gdb):

- use debugger; statement
- available commands: run, backtrace, list
- run your js with debug flag:


    node debug path/to/your/file
